[00:28.22] The problem is all inside your head, she said to me
[00:33.10] The answer is easy if you take it logically
[00:37.73] I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
[00:42.15] There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
[01:04.15] 
[00:47.30] She said, it's really not my habit to intrude
[00:51.52] Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
[00:56.52] But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
[01:00.75] There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
[01:05.92] Fifty ways to leave your lover
[01:20.92] 
[01:10.07] You just slip out the back, Jack
[01:12.60] Make a new plan, Stan
[01:14.89] You don't need to be coy, Roy
[01:16.96] Just get yourself free
[01:19.88] Hop on the bus, Gus
[01:21.89] You don't need to discuss much
[01:24.45] Just drop off the key, Lee
[01:26.54] And get yourself free
[01:37.04] 
[01:28.94] Ooh, slip out the back, Jack
[01:31.24] Make a new plan, Stan
[01:33.54] You don't need to be coy, Roy
[01:35.88] You just listen to me
[01:38.54] Hop on the bus, Gus
[01:40.51] You don't need to discuss much
[01:43.27] Just drop off the key, Lee
[01:45.32] And get yourself free
[01:55.82] 
[01:51.52] She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain
[01:55.14] I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
[01:59.86] I said I appreciate that and would you please explain
[02:04.47] About the fifty ways
[02:14.47] 
[02:10.09] She said, why don't we both just sleep on it tonight?
[02:14.18] And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
[02:18.62] And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
[02:23.33] There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
[02:28.69] Fifty ways to leave your lover
[02:43.69] 
[02:33.08] You just slip out the back, Jack
[02:35.60] Make a new plan, Stan
[02:37.80] You don't need to be coy, Roy
[02:40.16] Just get yourself free
[02:42.63] Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus
[02:44.76] You don't need to discuss much
[02:47.32] Just drop off the key, Lee
[02:49.55] And get yourself free
[03:00.05] 
[02:52.35] Slip out the back, Jack
[02:54.48] Make a new plan, Stan
[02:56.77] You don't need to be coy, Roy
[02:58.96] You just listen to me
[03:01.47] Hop on the bus, Gus
[03:03.76] You don't need to discuss much
[03:06.22] Just drop off the key, Lee
[03:08.41] And get yourself free
